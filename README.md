In this github repository I leave all experiments and analysis on my thesis "Towards album artwork generation based on audio", see on https://drive.google.com/file/d/1scFpsCY6XIzlZHmDzzWI2GryafkLyglI/view?usp=sharing

### Abstract
Music albums nowadays, can not be conceived without its artwork. Since first used, album
artwork importance has changed. In our digital era, audiovisual content is everywhere
and of course, regarding music albums, album covers play an important role. Computer
Vision has unleashed powerful technologies for image generation,in the last decade, which
have been used for lots of different applications. In particular, the main discoveries are
Varational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Latest
researches on these technologies have contributed to understand and improve them, ac-
quiring high quality and complex image generation. In this thesis, we experiment with the
latest image generation tools to achieve album artwork generation based on audio sam-
ples. We first analyse image generation without audio conditioning for VAEs and the three
GAN approaches: vanilla GAN, Least Squares GAN (LSGAN) and Wasserter GAN with
gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). Finally, we try the best model, from these experiment but
with audio conditioning. Despite being able to generate new album covers without audio
conditioning, we do not achieve the final objective of album cover generation based on
audio. We manually discuss, which state of the art tools could be reviewed and implemented
for this project.
